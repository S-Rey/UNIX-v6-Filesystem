# UNIX-v6-Filesystem

This is the repository of the project System Oriented Programmation at [EPFL](www.epfl.ch). It contains all the code of
the project.
The goal of this project was to familiarize us with the development of a large program in C. We developed a simplified implementation of the UNIX version 6 filesystem, dating from 1970.
