This is the repository of the project System Oriented Programmation at [EPFL](www.epfl.ch). It contains all the code of
the project.
The goal of this project was to familiarise us with the developement of a large program in c. We developped an
simplified implementation ot teh UNIX version 6 filesystem, dating back 1970.
